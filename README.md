# Personal Website
www.juyonbae.com
This project creates my personal website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal was to build a simple, minimalistic website to showcase my skills and interests. The site uses Netlify for deployment.

## About
My personal website offers a curated glimpse into my creative endeavors. 

The site was built using:
HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JavaScript
Netlify for hosting

# Features
The website includes:

A landing page 
An about page that 
A project page that lists my projects and links to github repositories
A contact page with ways to get in touch

Responsive mobile-first design with photos I took
Smooth scrolling and transitions between sections
Netlify form handling and deployment

# Running the Site Locally
To run the site locally:

Clone this repo
Open index.html in your browser
Explore the pages and images!
Note: The Netlify form functionality will only work on the deployed site. Locally, the form is static.

# Live Site and Netlify
The site is deployed on Netlify and can be viewed live at: juyonbae.com

Netlify was used to:

Host the site and make it publicly accessible
Handle form submissions from the contact page
Rebuild and redeploy the site upon Git pushes to the repo
This allows for continuous deployment and integration of the personal website.
